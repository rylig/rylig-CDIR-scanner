## 🛠 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Prepare Your IP Ranges

Create a file (e.g., `range.txt`) and add your IP ranges.

Each line should contain one CIDR range:

```
8.6.112.0/24
8.6.144.0/24
8.6.145.0/24
```

---

### 2. Run the Scanner

Run the script:

```bash
python scanner.py
```

You will be prompted to:

* Enter the path to your range file (e.g., `range.txt`)
* Enter the number of concurrent threads (how many IPs to scan at the same time)

---

### 3. View Results

* All responsive IPs will be saved automatically in:

```
active.txt
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Higher thread counts = faster scans, but more network load
* Use responsibly and only on networks you own or have permission to scan
* Works best on stable network connections
